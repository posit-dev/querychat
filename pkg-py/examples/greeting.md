Hello! I'm here to assist you with analyzing the Titanic dataset. Here are some examples of what you can ask me to do:

- **Filtering and Sorting:**
  - Show only passengers who boarded in Cherbourg.
  - Sort passengers by age in descending order.

- **Data Analysis:**
  - What is the survival rate for each passenger class?
  - How many children were aboard the Titanic?

- **General Statistics:**
  - Calculate the average age of female passengers.
  - Find the total fare collected from passengers who did not survive.

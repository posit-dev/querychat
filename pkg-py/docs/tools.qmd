QueryChat combines [tool calling](https://posit-dev.github.io/chatlas/get-started/tools.html) with [reactivity](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/reactive-foundations.html) to not only execute SQL, but also reactively update dependent data views. Understanding how these tools work will help you better understand what QueryChat is capable of and how to customize/extend to its behavior. 

One important thing to understand generally about Querychat's tools is they are Python functions, and that execution happens on _your machine_, not on the LLM provider's side. In other words, the SQL queries generated by the LLM are executed locally in the Shiny app process, and only the results (if any) are sent back to the LLM.

Querychat provides the LLM access to three tools, serving two primary purposes:

1. **Data updating** - Filter and sort data (without sending results to the LLM).
2. **Data analysis** - Calculate summaries and return results for interpretation by the LLM.

## Data updating

When a user asks to "Show me..." or "Filter to..." or "Sort by...", the LLM requests a call to the `update_dashboard` tool with an appropriate SQL query as input. An important constraint is that the query must return all original schema columns (typically using `SELECT *`). When called, Querychat will both set a reactive value holding [the current SQL query](build.qmd#sql-query) and execute the query to get the result.

The result of query then used to set a reactive value holding the [filtered/sorted data frame](build.qmd#filtered-data). Thanks to reactivity, this will automatically update any views depending on this data frame, such as the data table displayed in the UI.

This tool also takes a `title` parameter, which is a short description of the filter/sort operation (e.g., "First-class passengers"). This, also, is made available through [a reactive value](build.qmd#title) for display somewhere in your app.

Here's a basic example of this tool in action with the `.app()` method. Notice how this pre-built app not only shows the data table, but also the SQL query and title generated by the LLM (for transparency):

```{.python filename="titanic-app.py"}
from querychat import QueryChat
from seaborn import load_dataset

titanic = load_dataset("titanic")
qc = QueryChat(titanic, "titanic")
app = qc.app()
```

![](/images/quickstart-filter.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the querychat's app with the titanic dataset filtered to passengers who survived." class="lightbox shadow rounded mb-3"}

The other data updating tool is `reset_dashboard`, which clears any active filters and returns the data table to its original unfiltered state. The LLM typically uses this when users say "reset", "start over", or "clear filters".

## Data analysis

When a user asks analytical questions like "What is the average...?", "How many...?", or "Which item has the highest...?", the LLM generates a SQL query and requests a call to the `query` tool. Unlike the data updating tools, this tool will not update any reactive values. Instead, it will:

1. Execute the SQL query
2. Display both the SQL query and results in the UI
3. Return the results back to the LLM for interpretation

Here's an example of it in action:

```{.python filename="titanic-app.py"}
from querychat import QueryChat
from seaborn import load_dataset

titanic = load_dataset("titanic")
qc = QueryChat(titanic, "titanic")
app = qc.app()
```

![](/images/quickstart-summary.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the querychat's app with a summary statistic inlined in the chat." class="lightbox shadow rounded mb-3"}

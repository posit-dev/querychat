### Provide a greeting

When the querychat UI first appears, you will usually want it to greet the user with some basic instructions. By default, these instructions are auto-generated every time a user arrives; this is slow, wasteful, and unpredictable. Instead, you should create a greeting file and pass it when creating your `QueryChat` object:

```python
from pathlib import Path
qc = QueryChat(titanic, "titanic", greeting=Path("greeting.md"))
```

You can provide suggestions to the user by using the `<span class="suggestion"> </span>` tag:

```markdown
* **Filter and sort the data:**
  * <span class="suggestion">Show only survivors</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">Filter to first class passengers under 30</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">Sort by fare from highest to lowest</span>

* **Answer questions about the data:**
  * <span class="suggestion">What was the survival rate by gender?</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">What's the average age of children who survived?</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">How many passengers were traveling alone?</span>
```

These suggestions appear in the greeting and automatically populate the chat text box when clicked.
You can see this behavior in our [`querychat template`](https://shiny.posit.co/py/templates/querychat/).

### Generate a greeting

If you need help coming up with a greeting, you can use the `.generate_greeting()` method:

```python
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
from querychat import QueryChat

# Create QueryChat object with your dataset
penguins = load_penguins()
qc = QueryChat(penguins, "penguins")

# Generate a greeting (this calls the LLM)
greeting_text = qc.generate_greeting()
#> Hello! I'm here to help you explore and analyze the penguins dataset.
#> Here are some example prompts you can try:
#> ...

# Save it for reuse
with open("penguins_greeting.md", "w") as f:
    f.write(greeting_text)

# Then use the saved greeting in your app
qc = QueryChat(penguins, "penguins", greeting=Path("penguins_greeting.md"))
```

This approach generates a greeting once and saves it for reuse, avoiding the latency and cost of generating it for every user.

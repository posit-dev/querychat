# Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Explorer! ðŸš¢

I can help you explore and analyze data about Titanic passengers. 
Ask me questions about passengers, survival rates, or demographic information.

Try asking:
- Show me the first 10 passengers
- What was the survival rate for men vs women?
- How many passengers were in each class?
- What age groups had the highest survival rates?
- Show me all children who survived

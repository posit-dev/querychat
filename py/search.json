    "text": "How it works\n\nPowered by LLMs\nquerychat’s natural language chat experience is powered by LLMs. You may use any model that chatlas supports that has the ability to do tool calls, but we currently recommend (as of March 2025):\n\nGPT-4o\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet\n\nIn our testing, we’ve found that those models strike a good balance between accuracy and latency. Smaller models like GPT-4o-mini are fine for simple queries but make surprising mistakes with moderately complex ones; and reasoning models like o3-mini slow down responses without providing meaningfully better results.\nThe small open source models (8B and below) we’ve tested have fared extremely poorly. Sorry. 🤷\n\n\nPowered by SQL\nquerychat does not have direct access to the raw data; it can only read or filter the data by writing SQL SELECT statements. This is crucial for ensuring relability, transparency, and reproducibility:\n\nReliability: Today’s LLMs are excellent at writing SQL, but bad at direct calculation.\nTransparency: querychat always displays the SQL to the user, so it can be vetted instead of blindly trusted.\nReproducibility: The SQL query can be easily copied and reused.\n\nCurrently, querychat uses DuckDB for its SQL engine. It’s extremely fast and has a surprising number of statistical functions."

    "section": "Customizing querychat",
    "text": "Customizing querychat\n\nProvide a greeting (recommended)\nWhen the querychat UI first appears, you will usually want it to greet the user with some basic instructions. By default, these instructions are auto-generated every time a user arrives; this is slow, wasteful, and unpredictable. Instead, you should create a file called greeting.md, and when calling querychat.init, pass greeting=Path(\"greeting.md\").\nYou can provide suggestions to the user by using the &lt;span class=\"suggestion\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; tag.\nFor example:\n* **Filter and sort the data:**\n  * &lt;span class=\"suggestion\"&gt;Show only survivors&lt;/span&gt;\n  * &lt;span class=\"suggestion\"&gt;Filter to first class passengers under 30&lt;/span&gt;\n  * &lt;span class=\"suggestion\"&gt;Sort by fare from highest to lowest&lt;/span&gt;\n\n* **Answer questions about the data:**\n  * &lt;span class=\"suggestion\"&gt;What was the survival rate by gender?&lt;/span&gt;\n  * &lt;span class=\"suggestion\"&gt;What's the average age of children who survived?&lt;/span&gt;\n  * &lt;span class=\"suggestion\"&gt;How many passengers were traveling alone?&lt;/span&gt;\nThese suggestions appear in the greeting and automatically populate the chat text box when clicked. This gives the user a few ideas to explore on their own. You can see this behavior in our querychat template.\n\n\nGenerate a greeting\nIf you need help coming up with a greeting, you can use the querychat.greeting() function to generate one:\nimport querychat\nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\n\n# Create config with your dataset\npenguins = load_penguins()\npenguins_config = querychat.init(penguins, \"penguins\")\n\n# Generate a greeting\nquerychat.greeting(penguins_config)\n#&gt; Hello! I'm here to help you explore and analyze the penguins dataset.\n#&gt; Here are some example prompts you can try:\n#&gt; ...\n\n# Update the config with the generated greeting\npenguins_config = querychat.init(\n    penguins,\n    \"penguins\",\n    greeting=\"Hello! I'm here to help you explore and analyze the penguins dataset...\"\n)\nThis will use the LLM to generate a friendly greeting message with sample prompts. In Shiny apps, you could also generate the greeting once when the app starts up so that it’s shared among all users:\npenguins_config = querychat.init(penguins, \"penguins\")\npenguins_config.greeting = querychat.greeting(penguins_config, echo=\"none\")\n\n\nAugment the system prompt (recommended)\nIn LLM parlance, the system prompt is the set of instructions and specific knowledge you want the model to use during a conversation. querychat automatically creates a system prompt which is comprised of:\n\nThe basic set of behaviors the LLM must follow in order for querychat to work properly. (See querychat/prompt/prompt.md if you’re curious what this looks like.)\nThe SQL schema of the data frame you provided.\n(Optional) Any additional description of the data you choose to provide.\n(Optional) Any additional instructions you want to use to guide querychat’s behavior.\n\n\nData description\nIf you give querychat your dataset and nothing else, it will provide the LLM with the basic schema of your data:\n\nColumn names\nDuckDB data type (integer, float, boolean, datetime, text)\nFor text columns with less than 10 unique values, we assume they are categorical variables and include the list of values. This threshold is configurable.\nFor integer and float columns, we include the range\n\nAnd that’s all the LLM will know about your data. The actual data does not get passed into the LLM. We calculate these values before we pass the schema information into the LLM.\nIf the column names are usefully descriptive, it may be able to make a surprising amount of sense out of the data. But if your data frame’s columns are x, V1, value, etc., then the model will need to be given more background info–just like a human would.\nTo provide this information, use the data_description argument. For example, if you’re using the titanic dataset, you might create a data_description.md like this:\nThis dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, collected for predicting survival.\n\n- survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n- pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)\n- sex: Sex of passenger\n- age: Age in years\n- sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard\n- parch: Number of parents/children aboard\n- fare: Passenger fare\n- embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)\n- class: Same as pclass but as text\n- who: Man, woman, or child\n- adult_male: Boolean for adult males\n- deck: Deck of the ship\n- embark_town: Town of embarkation\n- alive: Survival status as text\n- alone: Whether the passenger was alone\nwhich you can then pass via:\nqc_config = querychat.init(\n    titanic,\n    \"titanic\",\n    data_description=Path(\"data_description.md\")\n)\nquerychat doesn’t need this information in any particular format; just put whatever information, in whatever format, you think a human would find helpful.\n\n\nAdditional instructions\nYou can add additional instructions of your own to the end of the system prompt, by passing extra_instructions into querychat.init.\nqc_config = querychat.init(\n    titanic,\n    \"titanic\",\n    extra_instructions=[\n        \"You're speaking to a British audience--please use appropriate spelling conventions.\",\n        \"Use lots of emojis! 😃 Emojis everywhere, 🌍 emojis forever. ♾️\",\n        \"Stay on topic, only talk about the data dashboard and refuse to answer other questions.\"\n    ]\n)\nYou can also put these instructions in a separate file and use Path(\"instructions.md\") to load them, as we did for data_description above.\nWarning: It is not 100% guaranteed that the LLM will always—or in many cases, ever—obey your instructions, and it can be difficult to predict which instructions will be a problem. So be sure to test extensively each time you change your instructions, and especially, if you change the model you use.\n\n\n\nUse a different LLM provider\nBy default, querychat uses GPT-4o via the OpenAI API. If you want to use a different model, you can provide a create_chat_callback function that takes a system_prompt parameter, and returns a chatlas Chat object:\nimport querychat\nimport chatlas\n\nqc_config = querychat.init(\n    titanic,\n    \"titanic\",\n    client=chatlas.ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\")\n)\nThis would use Claude 3.7 Sonnet instead, which would require you to provide an API key. See the chatlas documentation for more information on how to authenticate with different providers."

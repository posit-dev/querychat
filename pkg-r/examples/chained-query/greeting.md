# Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Query Explorer! ðŸš¢

I can help you explore and analyze data about Titanic passengers. 
Ask me questions about passengers, survival rates, or demographic information, 
and I'll generate SQL queries to get the answers.

Try asking:
- Show me the first 10 passengers
- What was the survival rate for men vs women?
- How many passengers were in each class?
- What age groups had the highest survival rates?

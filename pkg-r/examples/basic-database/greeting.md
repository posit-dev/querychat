# Welcome to the Database Query Assistant! ðŸ“Š

I can help you explore and analyze the iris dataset from the connected database. 
Ask me questions about the iris flowers, and I'll generate SQL queries to get the answers.

Try asking:
- Show me the first 10 rows of the iris dataset
- What's the average sepal length by species?
- Which species has the largest petals?
- Create a summary of measurements grouped by species

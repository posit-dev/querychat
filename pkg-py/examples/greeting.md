Hello! Welcome to your Titanic data dashboard. I'm here to help you filter, sort, and analyze the data. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* Explore the data
  * <span class="suggestion">Show me all passengers who survived</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">Show only first class passengers</span>
* Analyze statistics
  * <span class="suggestion">What is the average age of passengers?</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">How many children were on board?</span>
* Compare and dig deeper
  * <span class="suggestion">Which class had the highest survival rate?</span>
  * <span class="suggestion">Show the fare distribution by embarkation town</span>

Let me know what you'd like to explore!
